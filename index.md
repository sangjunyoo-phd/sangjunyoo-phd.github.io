Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern University. I have expert knowledge in characterizing soft matter at the air-water interface using synchrotron-sourced X-rays. My research topic is about the adsorption of Lanthanide elements to the charged floating monolayer, especially the ion-specific interaction and complexation. I am also interested in the application of my fundamental findings: such as solvent extraction of Lanthanide elements.

My current interest outside of academic research is Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am especially interested in forecasting models (time-series or sequential) because of their infinite potential for real-life applications.

I am a self-starter, a question thrower, and a problem solver. I also love indoor sports climbing.
