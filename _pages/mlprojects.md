**Work in progress**

List of Machine Learning projects: Summary only.
* Climbing Qualification prediction
* Image Quantizer: James Webb image
* S&P 500 index predictor with LSTM
* BCG Virtual program

# IFSC Climbing Worldcup Qualification Predictor
* Exploratory projects to be farmiliarized with classify problems. (I already feel farmiliar with regressions due to research experience)
* Goal: Get through a DS project including EDA, Feature Engineering, Modeling, and Evaluation with classification problem
* Logistic Regression, Support Vector classifier, and Random Forest model were deployed
* No significant difference were found between Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier models (accuracy: ~0.8). Random Forest yielded slightly worse performance (accuracy: ~0.7)
