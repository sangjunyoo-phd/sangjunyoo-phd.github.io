A lot of data analysis and mathematical formulations are done during research. This page showcases how I did them in detail.

## X-ray Reflectivity Analysis

X-ray reflectivity is one of the most powerful tools to characterize the composition of the surface along the surface normal.
The specular reflectivity intensity profile as a function of incident (=reflection) angle contains information about the electron density of the material along the z-axis (when surface is x-y plane).

$$ \frac{R(Q_{z})} {R_{F} (Q_{z})} = \left| \frac{1}{\rho_{\infty}} \int \frac{d \rho (z)}{dz} e^{i Q_{z}z} dz \right| ^{2} $$
