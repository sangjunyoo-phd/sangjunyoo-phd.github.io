A lot of data analysis and mathematical formulations are done during research. This page showcases how I did them in detail.

## X-ray Reflectivity Analysis

X-ray reflectivity is one of the most powerful tools to characterize the composition of the surface along the surface normal.
The specular reflectivity intensity profile as a function of incident (=reflection) angle contains information about the electron density of the material along the z-axis (when surface is x-y plane).

$$ {R(Q_{z})} \over {R_{F} (Q_{z})} = \| f(x) \| $$
