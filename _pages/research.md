### Retrieving precious Lanthanide ions from water

Solvent Extraction, a mechanism that transfers ions from water to oil with the assistance of amphiphilic molecules (extractant), is a widely used method to retrieve precious metals from wastewater.
However, lack of selectivity leads to hundreds of cycles of solvent extraction to achieve industry-relevant purity which makes the retrieving process energy-intensive and generates environmental pollutants (off-gassing acid and organic solvent).
Transferring mechanism of metallic ions through liquid-liquid extraction is essential to understanding and improving the selectivity of the separation process. 
I do research adsorption of Lanthanide elements to a charged extractant Langmuir monolayer at the air-water interface with synchrotron-sourced X-rays.
