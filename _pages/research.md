Solvent Extraction, a mechanism that transfers ions from water to oil with the assistance of amphiphilic molecules (extractant), is a widely used method to retrieve precious metals from wastewater.
However, lack of selectivity leads to hundreds of cycles of solvent extraction to achieve industry-relevant purity which makes the retrieving process energy-intensive and generates environmental pollutants (off-gassing acid and organic solvent).

Transferring mechanism of metallic ions through liquid-liquid extraction is essential to understanding and improving the selectivity of the separation process. 
I have been researching adsorption of Lanthanide elements to a charged extractant Langmuir monolayer at the air-water interface with synchrotron-sourced X-rays.

## Spontaneous Ion-Specific Complexation of Heavier Lanthanide at the Air-Water Interface

It is well known that extractant molecules form monolayers at the air-water and liquid-liquid interface.
This is still true when there is a light lanthanide element (an atomic number less than 65) in the solution.
However, with heavier lanthanide elements (Z>65), a characteristic bilayer structure was found with X-ray scattering.
Its structure is easily detachable from the water, so the ion-specific formation of the bilayer structure can be beneficial to the selective extraction of heavier lanthanide elements

## The Role of the Bilayer Structure in the Model Extraction System

The previous found motivated me to perform the model extraction with Er (heavier lanthanide; bilayer) and Nd (lighter lanthanide; monolayer)
