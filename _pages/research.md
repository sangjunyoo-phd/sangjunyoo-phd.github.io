excerpt: "Solvent Extraction, a mechanism that transfers ions from water to oil with the assistance of amphiphilic molecules (extractant), is a widely used method to retrieve and separate precious lanthanide elements from wastewater. However, lack of selectivity leads to hundreds of cycles of solvent extraction to achieve industry-relevant purity which makes the process energy-intensive and generates huge environmental pollutants.<br/>
Understanding the transferring mechanism of metallic ions through the water surface is essential to optimizing and improving the selectivity of the separation process. I have been researching the adsorption of Lanthanide elements to a charged extractant Langmuir monolayer at the air-water interface on the molecular scale with synchrotron-sourced X-rays."

    title: "The Role of an Interfacial Bilayer Structure in the Selectivity in the Solvent Extraction"
    excerpt: 'My recent X-ray studies have found ion-specific complexation of extractant and heavier lanthanides. This interfacial bilayer structure and its ion-selective nature are believed to be beneficial for better extraction and selective extraction of heavier lanthanides than the lighter ones. (See below study) To investigate this possibility, I performed model extractions with Er (heavier & bilayer) and Nd (lighter & monolayer). The extraction results are evaluated with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).<br/>
    The study revealed **the bilayer structure results in better and faster extraction as well as selective extraction**. I also found that lower extractant concentration leads to a better separation ratio of Er/Nd, which I postulated as a less saturated interface (low extractant concentration) hinders the bilayer (Er) and monolayer (Nd) domains extracted together.'

    title: "Spontaneous & Ion-Specific Complexation of Heavier Lanthanide with Extractant at the Air-Water Interface"
    excerpt: 'Extractant molecules at the interface are believed to form a monolayer structure during the solvent extraction process. However, recent synchrotron X-ray studies have revealed that surfactants form an inverted bilayer structure with one of the heavier lanthanide elements (Er). Since it has a hydrophobic surface, it is believed to be beneficial for better extraction. (transferring ions from water to oil)<br/>
    I discovered the ion-selective nature of this interfacial structure: **The bilayer structure is only formed when there are heavier lanthanide elements** evidenced by X-ray scattering, while lighter elements still form monolayers. X-ray fluorescence also revealed this structure doubled the number of adsorbed ions to the surface which is not only beneficial for a better extraction but also  the preferential extraction of the heavier lanthanides.'

    title: "Electrostatic Origin of Lanthanide Adsorption to a Charged Surfactant Monolayer"
    excerpt: 'There is a ubiquitous rule in lanthanide (Ln) extraction: **Heavier elements extracted better than the Lighter ones**. Although it is widely known empirical knowledge, there are not so many studies to understand this phenomenon on a nano-scale. **I used synchrotron-sourced X-rays to characterize the adsorption of Er (heavier Ln) and Nd (lighter Ln) to a negatively charged monolayer**.<br/>
    As the bulk ion concentration goes up, a stepwise trend of ion adsorption (no adsorption to fully saturated) was observed by the X-ray scattering method. Selective adsorption of Er over Nd was also measured by X-ray fluorescence measurement. In collaboration with a simulation research group, this stepwise trend is explained by electrostatic interaction between ions and charged headgroup of the monolayer'
