### Retrieving precious Lanthanide ions from water

Solvent Extraction, a mechanism that transfers ions from water to oil with assistance of amphiphilic molecues (extractant), is widely used method to retrieve precious metals from the waste water.
However, lack of selectivity leads to hundreds of cycles of solvent extraction to achieve industry-relevant purity which makes the retrieving process energy-intensive and generates environmental pollutants (off-gassing acid and organic solvent).
Transferring mechanism of metallic ions through the liquid-liquid extraction is essential to understand and improve selectivity of the separation process. 
I do research adsorption of Lanthanide elements to a charged extractant Langmuir monolayer at the air-water interface with synchrotron sourced X-rays.
